## Hello, there! ðŸ¤“
My name is Mariana. I'm from Brazil, Rio de Janeiro. 
I'm graduated in advertising and now I'm studying a postgraduate in Brazilian Sign Language (Libras).
I'm also dedicated to studying about digital accessibility, and in search of collaborating with this subject, I'm studying to be a Quality Analyst professional.
